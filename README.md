WHAT SSTC IS:
SSTC Underground is made by a student for students across the world. Here, you can trade items (in any form: physical, digital, etc.) by putting up listings for you item(s).
How to use SSTC:
 You can put up listings with your contact information such as your username or email or whatever you wish. You can provide a breif description of the item along with an optional picture in any format. You can make and have friends, make trading groups and have separate logins. The admins can put up banners on a speciel occasion or just for fun.
 Why SSTC:
 SSTC has a beautiful UI complete with interactive panels and buttons. The SSTC UI is built to feel underground so it has a nice, golden, glowy, pirate theme to it.
 DA Code that powers SSTC:
 SSTC is powered by a javascript backend along with a HTML frontend complete with some style CSS code that makes its beauty shine out.
 Why SSTC needs funding:
 Right now, SSTC has been made to operate with your device's browser's local storage. So you can test this by opening multiple tabs in your browser and whatever you do in one tab will be stored in the whole browser, so all the other SSTC tabs will remember it. BUT, coming to the point, due to the browser's local storage limitations, you cannot truely use it to trade something with listings or create friends or make groups between two different devices around the world. So, to make SSTC real, I will have to arrange a server for this which costs money, hence i need your help.
 Additional points on why to fund SSTC:
 SSTC has some minor glitches that I am fixing one by one and I am also updating all my peripherals once in a while as a big update once in a while. To keep fixing these minor bugs and to also make the website real, Money and time, so funding does a LOT of help. And also, funding will also help justify my life choices of spending WEEKS of time and TONS of toil just to write the 800 lines of code that are there to make SSTC as a 8th grader. And this is open source so you can use my code, no worries.
 Thanks for reading, I hope you do end up funding me or atleast found this interesting or entertaining.
